# Political Sentimental Analysis in Tamil
Sentiment analysis is an important area in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to understand and classify opinions or emotions in text. In the political field, knowing public sentiment helps to understand opinions, solve issues, and shape better policies. Social media platforms like Twitter (now X) are widely used for expressing thoughts and have become a great source of real-time political discussions. 

This paper focuses on the shared task of Political Multiclass Sentiment Analysis of Tamil tweets, where the goal is to classify tweets into specific sentiment categories. We explain our approach, which involves preprocessing the Tamil text, extracting useful features, and using machine learning and deep learning models for classification. 

The results of our experiments show the effectiveness of our methods, and we also discuss some challenges we faced while working on Tamil political sentiment analysis
